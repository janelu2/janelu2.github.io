This is my first post. There's not much to say here.
I made this to host a reference table for countries and currencies
so that I don't need to keep googling them for work. I think this
solution may be over-engineered, but it's better than having a repository
only exist for a markdown page! Maybe I'll find more uses for this site eventually.
